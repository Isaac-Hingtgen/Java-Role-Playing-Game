The builder design pattern will be used to instantiate enemies as the player moves down floors. So that only easier enemies will be created at the top. This design pattern may also be used for determining the loot drops and finds from enemies, chests, and the shop, so that the quality of the items increases as the player progresses.

The strategy design pattern will be used to determine how enemies respond to the player, critical strike/miss/block chance.

The wrapper design patter will be used to implement status effects, weapons/armour stats, and character stats.
