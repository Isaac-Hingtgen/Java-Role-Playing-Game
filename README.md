A5a:

The factory method design pattern will be used to instantiate enemies as the player moves down floors. So that only easier enemies will be created at the top. This design pattern may also be used for determining the loot drops and finds from enemies, chests, and the shop, so that the quality of the items increases as the player progresses.

The strategy design pattern will be used to determine how enemies respond to the player, critical strike/miss/block chance.

The wrapper design patter will be used to implement status effects, weapons/armour stats, and character stats.

A5b:

After gradle run, input 4 to enter demo mode. It will stop every ten floors and do a basic display of stats and such. Eventually, the demo does ask to choose and ascedency affinity, select any at random, it will change the special attack skill. 

If running on a shell without text colors and extra characters are displaying with the "Input: #", please go into Start.displayInput() and change the if statement to false.
